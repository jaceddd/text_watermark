            <b> &ensp;&ensp;Using this <i>hexadecimal zero-width steganoraphy</i> kit, you can now:</b> send invisible messages, decode invisible messages, confuse AI, watermark blog posts, paste invisible characters in things where they do not belong or stealthily add a unique watermark to any text that people copy and paste from your website. It is also theoretically possible to poison an AI's training data using the spammer or even mess with google search results using the meta tag.
            <BR>&ensp;&ensp;The encryption on the URL and COOKIE versions has around 355687430000000 possible key combinations making it both invisible and difficult to crack. They are not 100% secure and should by no means be used to transmit anything super sensitive. Please do not abuse this tool, it is for fun and research only. Each section has a more detailed description included in it. Please enjoy! You are free to use it without the license but if you incorperate the code into any project please include the <a href="LICENSE.md">license</a> file so others may find it!

        <div class="tool texter tw_original" id="tm_original">
        <b class="tool_title">Text Watermark original</b><br>
        Start here. The original way to send invisible messages using hexadecimal steganographic zero width characters. None of these tools require an internet connection, everything is done locally.
        </div>

        <div class="tool texter tw_get">
            <b class="tool_title">Encrypted URL version.</b><br>
            "Encrypted" way to send invisible messages, works locally using URL query strings. Use this one for enhanced privacy. Much more secure than the original version as it uses a keycode but please read the note on how secure it actually is.
        </div>

        <div class="tool texter tw_cookie">
        <b class="tool_title">Encrypted COOKIE version.</b><br>
        Semi encrypted way to send invisible messages that uses cookies to store the keycode. This version won't work locally on your machine using chrome, but will work on a HTTPS server.
        </div>

        <div class="tool texter add_clip">
        <b class="tool_title">Add zero witdth characters to clipboard</b><br>
            This simply lets you paste the characters one by one. It can be interesting to test these on various services and websites. Also good for pranks as code with one of these inside it will break.
        </div>

        <div class="tool texter spammer">
            <b class="tool_title">Text spammer / AI poisoner</b><br>
            This lets you seed a block of text with invisible zero width characters, this will make it an absolute nightmare to edit by other people. It makes it less likely that AI can detect and read what you have written. Use this tool with caution and please do not abuse this.
        </div>

        <div class="tool texter viewer">
            <b class="tool_title">View and remove</b><br>
            This lets you look at the invisible spaces with its visualizer and also allows you to totally strip out spaces from a block of text. Useful for reversing the spammer.
        </div>

        <div class="tool texter stealth">
            <b class="tool_title">Stealth clipboard adder</b><br>
            This adds a custom chain of hidden characters to any text the user copy pastes from the current page. If you use this code in your websites head meta tag, you can see who has stolen your content using google.
        </div>

        <div class="tool texter head_tag">
            <b class="tool_title">Meta tag tool</b>
            <br>
            Shall we build the Stegonet? This will make a meta tag so your site can be indexed with hidden characters. This can alter google search results. If you send a link to a google search with your hidden code it can put your website at the top of the results. Includes the ability to search google with zero width characters. Unsure if this still works, still research to be done.
