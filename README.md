Text watermark & Steganography toolkit - version 1.0.0

This project is a hexadecimal zero-width character text steganography kit written in javascript (runs in browser). It can hide totally invisible messages or watermarks within normal text. Works perfectly with discord, and some email clients.
	 As it uses hexadecimal you can hide fairly long invisible messages in any text. It does not require an internet connection to work as it is fully local, so your data is not intercepted anywhere until you send/publish your generated message.

To use:
Download, extract and open index.html.

There is also a live version if you just want to play with it.

Abilities:
- Encode and decode invisible encrypted messages in plain sight, via discord, email and other types of text communcation. 
- Watermark content with invisible characters to prevent theft and plagiarism.
- Seed text with zero width characters to avoid AI detectors, plagiarism checkers and deter editing and rewriters.
- Has potential to poison AI training data.
- Can spam text with spaces to potetially bypass spam email filters.
- Add invisible watermarks whenever somebody copy pastes anything from your website.
- Can be used on some badly coded services to have a totally invisible name or description.
- Generate meta and h1 tags for your website with an invisible code.
- Has an included server version that uses cookies if you wish to mirror this.
- View and strip invisible characters.
- Has high potential for mischief.

Problems:
- Some services filter out invisible characters. Use the inluded tester at the bottom of the various pages to see how the characters interact with a service before use.
- The encryption is difficult but not impossible to crack. The key code has 355687430000000 possible combinations, but a well designed cracker could break this (if anybody is up for the challenge it would be a fun project).

Contributions & education:
- If anybody would like to add to or improve this toolkit feel free.
- Also feel free to make content on youtube, or educational platforms if you find this interesting.
- If the author of the whitespace programming language ever see's this, feel free to make the nospace programming language. An esoteric language based on this would be pretty funny.

Extra content:
- I plan to include an extra weird character section when I get round to it and maybe an advanced version of Zalgo.
